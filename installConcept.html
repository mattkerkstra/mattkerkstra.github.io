  <h1>
  Concept
  </h1>

  <p>
  I will be filming four couples. Each person will be filmed independently. They will be instructed that they will have twenty minutes to say whatever they wish to or about their significant other. Ideally it will be something intimate - a confession or a profession of love. 

  </p>
  <p>
  After I've got audio/video from this that source material will be fed through several different filters leaving it anonymous visually and audibly. The aesthetic for the video will be a wireframe type of look based off the depth read by the kinect. The audio will seek to capture the rhythm and tone of the speech while destroying the content. This footage will then be applied to a monitor. 

  </p>
  <p>
  This will be installed in a room on the fourth floor in sewell. There will be four TVs on the left of the room and four on the right standing on pedestals I will make with the direction of Randall. The scale should be slightly less than bodily. Each pedestal and TV will vary in height/size/appearance. The room will be dark except for the light from the TVs and the entrance. Audio will be soft so you have to be close to the TVs to hear.
  </p>
